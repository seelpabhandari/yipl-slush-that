<b class="cs">SLUSH acts as a bridge between startups and investors, media and executives. Nepal, now more than ever, is excited about the prospects of booming business that are centered around technology. We have seen instances around the world where technology form the core of business, and successfully so. Lately, Nepal also has shown exciting prospects in this area. <br><br>We have start ups and we have established companies with innovative products that are not just nationally significant but also have international prospects. Right now, an opportunity to take these products to international investors is not just less, but nonexistent. SLUSH Nepal could be a pioneer in taking Nepalese products to an important international platform of a huge scale such as SLUSH. YoungInnovations as convener of mobile social networking hub <b class="d">(www.mobilenepal.net)</b> is proud to bring this event in Nepal.</b>
